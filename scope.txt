Lexical environment is local memory + reference to lexical environment of its parent.
Which means that if declare a variable globally ,then even multiple nested function will also have access to it,as that function has lexical environment indirectly pointing to the global execution context

JS will search for a variable in local memory first, if its not there then it will go to its parent's lexical environment and search
If its not there as well,then that function will go to lexical environment of it's parent
Basically this process continues untill we either find the variable or there are no more parent execution context.
This phenomenon is known as "Scope chaining"


Parent of global execution context is 'null'
