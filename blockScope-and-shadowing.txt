Block is also known as Compound statements. It is used to combine the multiple statements together

let & const are hoisted in a block scope. var is in global scope

let and const variables are stored in block space, so it is called block-scoped but var variables can be accessed outside the block as it is stored in the Global object memory space, hence it is called Global scoped.

Variable shadowing occurs when a variable declared in an inner scope has the same name as a variable in an outer scope, effectively hiding the outer variable within that scope.

Example 1: 
let x = 10; // Outer scope variable
function example() {
  let x = 20; // Inner scope variable, shadows outer 'x'
  console.log(x); // Prints 20
}
example(); //function call
console.log(x); // Prints 10

Example 2: 
console.log(a); //hoisting
var a = 9;
console.log(a);
{
 var a = 10;  //overwrite within same GEC , both var 'a' is pointing to same variable
 console.log(a)
}
console.log(a);

Output:
Undefined
9
10
10

variables declared with var are function-scoped or globally scoped, but they are not block-scoped like variables declared with let or const. So, the var a declared inside the block {} will override the outer var a declaration, and the value of a will be 10 when logged outside the block.

var variable of function scoped overwrites the value of Global Scoped variable.

Scope for arrow function is also same!

==================> 1
let a = 10
{
    var a = 100 //not allowed
}

===================> 2
var a = 40
{
    let a = 30 //allowed
}
console.log(a)
